of War, the fortune of battles,\\nThe making of perfect soldiers.', \"Be it so, then I answer'd,\\nI too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\\nWaged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance\\n    and retreat, victory deferr'd and wavering,\\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the\\n    field the world,\\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\\nLo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,\\nI above all promote brave soldiers.\\n\\n\\n\\n}\", \"In Cabin'd Ships at Sea\\n\\nIn cabin'd ships at sea,\\nThe boundless blue on every side expanding,\\nWith whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,\\nOr some lone bark buoy'd on the dense marine,\\nWhere joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,\\nShe cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under\\n    many a star at night,\\nBy sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,\\nIn full rapport at last.\", \"Here are our thoughts, voyagers' thoughts,\\nHere not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,\\nThe sky o'erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,\\nWe feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,\\nThe tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the\\n    briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,\\nThe perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,\\nThe boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,\\nAnd this is ocean's poem.\", \"Then
